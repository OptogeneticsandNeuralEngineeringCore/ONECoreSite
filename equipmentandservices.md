The Optogenetics and Neural Engineering (ONE) Core offers a variety of equipment and services for your research needs.

    It is the responsibility of the Renter to ensure that ALL USERS of the equipment have the training
                                  necessary for proper use of the equipment.
               Example: Any user of a laser must complete the EH&S Laser Training Module prior to use.

## Services
With a deep understanding of Mechanical Engineering and Neuroscience Engineering, the ONE Core aims to be *the* engineering resource for your research. Optics, Mechanical, Biological, Hardware, and Software Engineering (including data analysis) can all be customized to fit your needs. Please see our [projects page](/ONECoreWebSite/projects/) for example projects, but understand that we specialize in customization for your needs. All listed projects can be expanded to help you reach your goals. Some service keywords:
* [3D design and printing](https://github.com/OptogeneticsandNeuralEngineeringCore/SmallProjectFiles/raw/master/3D%20Poster.pdf)
  * microSLA High Resolution printing with a <a href="https://www.3dsystems.com/3d-printers/projet-1200" target="blank">3DSystems Projet1200</a>
  * Inexpensive FDM printing with a <a href="https://www.lulzbot.com/" target="blank">Lulzbot Taz</a>
    * General plastics: ABS, nGEN, plastics
    * Flexible, clear, and incredibly strong NinjaFLEX and SemiFLEX
    * Plastics filled with Iron Shavings (magnetic)
  * Assistance in choosing outside vendors for fabrication techniques outside of ONE Core abilities
* Custom design and fabrication of optic fibers and implants. Safe consultation on optic power and optic methodology (report irradiance consistently [in vivo](https://github.com/OptogeneticsandNeuralEngineeringCore/SmallProjectFiles/raw/master/Methods%20Section%20and%20Acknowledgement%20In%20Vivo.docx) or [in vitro](https://github.com/OptogeneticsandNeuralEngineeringCore/SmallProjectFiles/raw/master/Methods%20Section%20and%20Acknowledgement%20In%20Vitro.docx))
* Hardware design, fabrication, and diagnostics
* Software coding (including Matlab, Python, C++, Arduino, Raspberry Pi (Linux), website design (isn't <a href="/ONECoreWebSite/" target="blank">this one</a> pretty?))
* Other unique services:
