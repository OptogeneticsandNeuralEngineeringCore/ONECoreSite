# Optogenetics and Neural Engineering Core Web Site


**Optogenetics and Neural Engineering Core (ONE Core)** is an engineering resource for the School of Medicine at the University of Colorado Denver.

> The goal of the Optogenetics and Neural Engineering (ONE) Core is to facilitate the incorporation of optogenetics methods and custome engineering into existing research programs at the University of Colorado, Denver School of Medicine.

## Repo
This repository holds the files for the [ONE Core Web Site](https://optogeneticsandneuralengineeringcore.github.io/ONECoreSite/).You're welcome to poke around here, but check out the site. I put in effort to make a site that is accessible by people that might be intimitated by the github complexity.
