# RIVETs

Here is a remix of the RIVETs Essentials originally from the Dudman lab at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, as published in Osborne & Dudman (2014) PLoS One 9(2): e89007. See [here](http://dudmanlab.org/html/rivets.html) for the original design and files.

RIVETS is a trademark of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute with the US Patent and Trade Office. I'm not gonna trademark RIVETSRemix (though, it does sound like a sweet name for a DJ)...and I hope I'm not stomping on their trademark.

This design minimizes print volume and attempts to maximize access without sacrificing strength. It fits with original clamps.

The RIVETSRemix should be printed in a high resolution print (microSLA, for example a ProJet1200). It can be printed in the proprietary FTXGreen, or FunToDo Deep Black. The Holder can be printed on any FDM printer, 20% infill, nGen preferred, support anything over 45*. Assemble with 6-32 x 3/4" screws and nuts.

(I share the design file (ipt) in case anyone wants to make changes, but these were designed with sloppiness set to max. Looking at the file structure of the Holder is...cringe worthy. Sometimes it's easy (sloppy) to push ahead on 3D models rather than update drawing. Not my best work)

Don't have a 3D printer? Support the [ONE Core](mailto:neuralengineering@ucdenver.edu) and order though us!!!! Or use an inexpensive outside 3D printing shop. [Rosenberg Industries](mailto:j.rosenberg@rosenbergindustries.com) is aware of ONE Core projects and requirements  and has proven success with ONE Core projects.
