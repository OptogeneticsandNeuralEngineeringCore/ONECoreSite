# Introduction

Connecting Linux to Campus WiFi can be tricky. [Here](https://github.com/OptogeneticsandNeuralEngineeringCore/SmallProjectFiles/raw/master/Connecting%20Linux%20to%20Anschutz%20Wireless.docx) are some tips on connecting a basic Linux device to a Campus Wireless. Special attention is given to Ubuntu and Rasbian (Raspberry Pi). These are directly applicable to Wireless Networks CU Anschutz and CU Anschutz Guest.

Also, note that VPN programs frequently used by campuses don't often accommodate Linux. The Cisco Anyconnect at UCDenver will typically draw 100% of one CPU on your computer at all times (even when not in use). I might look into an alternative some day.
