# Irradiance

The optical power used in optogenetics is frequently reported in vague ways. As such, two researchers may use the exact same optical settings, but report it orders of magnitude separated. The discussions provided here hopes to address some of these inconsistencies. It is most important to discuss how the irradiance was measured so that the process is repeatable.

The optical power (typically in milliWatt (mW)) is reported over the area of stimulation (typically in millimeter (mm)), as that is what drives an opsin to change the membrane permeability and hence the membrane potential.

The following suggested method sections provide a clear way to report on irradiance, both for in-vivo and in-vitro. They both cover general optical considerations of a typical optogetnetics set up, including efficiency loss, on/off characteristics, and (for in-vivo) tapered fiber tips.
