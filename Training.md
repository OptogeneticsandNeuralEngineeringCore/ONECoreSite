The Optogenetics and Neural Engineering (ONE) Core frequently offers training in many areas of engineering, allowing you to focus on *your* research.

To inquire about the next training session, simply [contact](mailto:neuralengineering@ucdenver.edu) the ONE Core.

## Example Training
> *  Optical Safety: How to safely apply light to your research. Also covers how to correctly measure and report Irradiance [in Vitro](https://github.com/OptogeneticsandNeuralEngineeringCore/SmallProjectFiles/raw/master/Methods%20Section%20and%20Acknowledgement%20In%20Vitro.pdf) and [in Vivo](https://github.com/OptogeneticsandNeuralEngineeringCore/SmallProjectFiles/raw/master/Methods%20Section%20and%20Acknowledgement%20In%20Vivo.pdf) <br>
> * Patch cord and optical cannula fabrication. Ask about our station through which you build these in house <br>
> * Microcontrollers: the future of research control. Can include training on Arduino programing (learn to hack!) or Raspberry Pi consideration <br>
> * Electronic Workbench: Common methods to build, diagose, and repair hardware issues <br>
> * An introduction to 3D Modeling and Printing. What method will best suit your needs <br>
> * Other: consultation is always free of charge. [Contact us!](mailto:neuralengineering@ucdenver.edu) <br>
