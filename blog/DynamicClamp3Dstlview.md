caption: Control your patch clamping like never before on the cheap
description: >
    A very inexpensive Teensy is placed on a breadboard with several other circuits to create a Dynamic Clamp with sufficient resolution and timing for controlling your patch clamp recordings.

# View and interact with the 3D files

*If interact-able views of the 3D parts do not load, try reloading the page. If that doesn't work, view them on the GitHub pages or update your browser.* Only a couple of .stl's are show, so as not to overwhelm your browser. You should get the idea, but if not visit the [barebones github](https://github.com/OptogeneticsandNeuralEngineeringCore/DynamicClamp).

Dynamic Clamp Top Better-er:
(The BNC labels are listed, there is a port for reset, the voltage supply is listed, and the ONE Core logo is there (ain't it pretty?))
